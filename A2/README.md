  # Assessment 2: Adventure!
 
 You've fallen into a strange underground lair and want out. 
 A first encounter tells you what you must do: make a key
 that will open an ancient stone door.

--------------------------------------------------------------

## Skills Practised In This Assessment
  
  - Creating + using functions with arguments and return values
  - Formatting output using an open source library: fmt (format)
  - Keeping track of the state play in the program
    + Specific: What has player done, what's left to be done
    + Abstract: Remembering changes to things over time, 
                taking next actions based on this info
  - Simple use of containers - the vector (if we get there)
 
-------------------------------------------------------------
## What To Do
  
  - Fix the broken functions
  - Look for the todos in main for remaining encounters/features
    that are needed
  - Look for other todos for functions that need to be created
    or completed
  - Format the creature dialogue using fmt's prints' styles
  - Use colour/style elsewhere to communicate the player's situation,
    their choices.
